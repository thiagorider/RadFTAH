abstract={Hardware fault-insertion test (FIT) is a promising method for system reliability test and diagnosis coverage measurement. It improves the speed of releasing a quality diagnostic program before manufacturing and provides feedbacks of fault tolerance of a very complicated large system. Certain level insufficient fault tolerance can be fixed in the current system but others may require ASIC or overall system architectural modifications. The FIT is achieved by introducing an artificial fault (defect modeling) at the pin level of a module to mimic any physical defect behavior within the module, such as SEU (single event upset) or escaped delay defect. We present a hardware architectural solution for pin fault insertion. We also present a simulation framework and optimization techniques for a subset of module pin selection for FIT, such that desired coverage are obtained under the constraints of limited FIT pins due to the costs of the associated implementation. Experimental results are presented for selected ISCAS and OpenCore benchmarks, as well as for an industrial circuit.},
