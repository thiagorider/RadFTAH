abstract={In this paper two low-cost solutions devoted to provide processor-based systems with error detection capabilities are compared. The effects of SEUs and SETs are studied through simulation-based fault injection. The error detection capabilities of a hardware-implemented solution, based on parity code, are compared with those of a software-implemented solution based on source-level code modification. Radiation testing experiments confirmed results obtained by simulation.},
