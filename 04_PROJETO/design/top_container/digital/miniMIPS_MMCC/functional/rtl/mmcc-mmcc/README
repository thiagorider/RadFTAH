======================
MMCC
======================

It's a VHDL specification of a multicore archtecture based on mips R3000


Requirements
============

Before compiling it you will need to untar the mmcc_depencies.tar on the
src folder, and them compile the two closed modules:

 cd src/unisims; ./build.sh
 cd src/xil_cores && make

Those modules can be found on Xilinxs WebPack, for free on the web, but due
to licensing issues, we can't distribute them.
We're working to find a open-source alternative soon.

Compiling
============

After compiling the dependencies, you're able to compile MMCC by typing

 make;

on the root folder.
